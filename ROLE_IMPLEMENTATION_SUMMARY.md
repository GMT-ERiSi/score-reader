# Player Role Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This new feature adds support for player roles ("Farmer", "Flex", "Support") to the Star Wars Squadrons statistics system. It includes:

1. Primary role tracking in the reference database
2. Per-match role assignment during data processing
3. Role-specific reports and statistics
4. Role filtering for ELO ladders

## Files Created

I've prepared the following files with the necessary code changes:

1. **Reference Database Updates**:
   - `reference_manager_update.py` - Updated `initialize_db` method
   - `reference_manager_functions.py` - Updated reference manager functions
   - `interactive_player_management.py` - Updated player management interface

2. **Stats Database Updates**:
   - `modules/database_utils_update.py` - Updated database schema
   - `modules/player_processor_update.py` - Updated player stats processing
   - `modules/report_generator_update.py` - Updated report generation

3. **Implementation Guide**:
   - `ROLE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions for implementation

## Implementation Approach

You have two options for implementing these changes:

### Option 1: Manual Integration

Use the files I've created as references to update your existing code:

1. Update `reference_manager.py` with the changes in `reference_manager_update.py` and `reference_manager_functions.py`
2. Update `modules/database_utils.py` with the changes in `modules/database_utils_update.py`
3. Update `modules/player_processor.py` with the changes in `modules/player_processor_update.py`
4. Update `modules/report_generator.py` with the changes in `modules/report_generator_update.py`

This approach gives you more control over the changes but requires more careful integration.

### Option 2: Direct File Replacement

Replace the existing files completely with the new versions:

1. Make backups of your original files
2. Replace the original files with the updated versions

This approach is faster but less controlled.

## Testing

After implementing the changes, follow the testing process outlined in the `ROLE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` to verify everything works correctly.

## Key User Experiences

With these changes, users will be able to:

1. Assign primary roles to players in the reference database
2. Override roles on a per-match basis during data processing
3. View role-based statistics in reports
4. Filter ELO ladders by role

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation guide to understand all changes
2. Choose your implementation approach
3. Make the necessary changes
4. Test the new functionality with a small dataset
5. Update any documentation to reference the new role feature
