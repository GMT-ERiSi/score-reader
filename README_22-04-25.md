```

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Harry84/score-reader
    cd score-reader
    ```

2.  Set up Python environment:
    ```powershell
    # Run the provided setup script to configure environment
    .\env-setup.ps1

    # Or manually set up the environment:
    # Note: These instructions assume pyenv-win is installed. If not, you can install it or use
    # a regular Python installation instead of 3.10.9 (if not already installed)
    pyenv install 3.10.9

    # Set local Python version
    pyenv local 3.10.9

    # Create and activate virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Edit the .env file to add your Claude API key

4.  Place your screenshots in the `../Screenshots` folder (at the same level as the project folder) in the appropriately named folder

## Standard Workflow for Team Matches

1.  **Add new screenshots** to the appropriate folder in the `../Screenshots` folder

2.  **Process screenshots**:
    ```bash
    python -m score_extractor.season_processor --base-dir ../Screenshots --output-dir "Extracted Results"
    ```
    This generates `Extracted Results/all_seasons_data.json`.

### Date Handling during Extraction

The extraction process (`score_extractor/season_processor.py`) attempts to determine the match date automatically from the screenshot filename. It looks for specific patterns:

1.  `Star Wars Squadrons Screenshot YYYY.MM.DD - HH.MM.SS[.ms].png`
2.  `YYYY[.-]MM[.-]DD[_HH.MM.SS].png` (Time defaults to 12:00:00 if missing)

The extracted date is always converted to the standard `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` format.

**Important Fallback:** If a valid date cannot be extracted from the filename using these patterns, the script will **prompt the user** during the extraction run:

Could not extract a valid date from filename. Please enter date (YYYY-MM-DD) or press Enter to use the current date:

-   If you enter a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, it will be used with the time set to `00:00:00`.
-   If you press Enter without typing anything, or if your input is invalid, the script will default to using the **current date and time** when the script is run (time set to `00:00:00`).

This ensures that every match record processed has a `match_date` field added to the raw JSON output. Note that the subsequent database processing step (`stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct.py`) will also display this date and prompt for confirmation or override before saving to the database.

3.  **Clean the extracted data** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m stats_reader clean --input "Extracted Results/all_seasons_data.json" --output "Extracted Results/all_seasons_data_cleaned.json"
    ```
    This launches an interactive tool to review and correct potential AI extraction errors (scores, team names, results) by comparing against the original screenshots. Don't worry about slightly different player names for the same person here; that's handled in the next step.

4.  **Populate and manage the reference database**:
    ```bash
    # Start fresh by deleting any existing reference database if needed
    # del squadrons_reference.db

    # Populate the reference database with player names from the CLEANED data
    python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --db squadrons_reference.db --populate-from-json "Extracted Results/all_seasons_data_cleaned.json"

    # Then manage teams and players using the interactive tool
    python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --db squadrons_reference.db --manage
    ```

    When using the management interface:
    1.  Choose "Team Management" to first create any teams you need.
    2.  Then select "Player Management" to assign players to their primary teams and use "Resolve Duplicate Player IDs" to merge different names for the same player (e.g., "PlayerA" and "Player A") into a single canonical entry. This also updates the `_cleaned.json` file for consistency.

    Setting primary teams is important for tracking substitute appearances.

5.  **Process data into database**:
    ```bash
    # Use the CLEANED data as input
    python -m stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct --input "Extracted Results/all_seasons_data_cleaned.json" --reference-db squadrons_reference.db
    ```

    When prompted during processing, choose the match type. The processor will now prompt you to select the match type (team, pickup, ranked) at the beginning, which eliminates the need for further special steps to remove team IDs for pickup and ranked games. It will also prompt for player roles based on the reference database.

6.  **Generate ELO ladder**:
    ```bash
    python -m stats_reader.elo_ladder --match-type team
    ```

    This will create team ELO reports in the `stats_reports` directory.

## Workflow for Pickup/Ranked Matches

For processing pickup or ranked matches:

1.  **Process screenshots** as in the standard workflow.

2.  **Clean the extracted data** as in the standard workflow.

3.  **Process the data as pickup/ranked matches**:
    ```bash
    # Generic command:
    python -m stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct --input "Extracted Results/[FOLDER]/[FOLDER]_results_cleaned.json" --reference-db squadrons_reference.db
    # Example if we pretend SCL15 folder has pickup matches in it (just to show the command):
    python -m stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct --input "Extracted Results/SCL15/SCL15_results_cleaned.json" --reference-db squadrons_reference.db
    # The default db for the --db argument is squadrons_stats.db (i.e. if you don't specify a db name via the arg)
    # To process towards a db of your choice (for example to have a separate database for pickup vs SPBL vs SCL vs ranked):
    -   python -m stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct --input "Extracted Results/SCL15/SCL15_results_cleaned.json" --reference-db squadrons_reference.db --db squadrons_pickup.db
    ```

    When prompted during processing:
    -   Choose "pickup" or "ranked" as the match type
    -   The processor will automatically:
        -   Assign generic team names ("Imp_pickup_team"/"NR_pickup_team" or "Imperial_ranked_team"/"NR_ranked_team")
        -   Set player team_ids to NULL for proper pickup/ranked tracking
    -   You will be prompted to confirm/enter player roles for each match.

4.  **Generate player-based ELO ladder**:
    ```bash
    # For pickup matches (preferred method)
    python -m stats_reader.player_elo_ladder --db squadrons_stats.db --output "elo_reports_pickup" --match-type pickup

    # For ranked matches
    python -m stats_reader.player_elo_ladder --db squadrons_stats.db --output "stats_reports" --match-type ranked
    ```

    This will create:
    -   For pickup matches: Reports in the `elo_reports_pickup` directory
        -   `pickup_player_elo_ladder.json`: Current ELO ratings for individual players
        -   `pickup_player_elo_history.json`: Full history of player ELO changes (including roles)
    -   For ranked matches: Reports in the `stats_reports` directory
        -   `ranked_player_elo_ladder.json`: Current ELO ratings for ranked players
        -   `ranked_player_elo_history.json`: Full history of ranked player ELO changes (including roles)

5.  **View generated reports** to analyze player performance.

## Key Differences between Team and Pickup/Ranked Processing

-   **Team Assignment**: In team matches, players represent specific teams. In pickup/ranked matches, players play for themselves regardless of their primary team affiliation.
-   **ELO Calculation**: Team matches use team-based ELO. Pickup/ranked matches use player-based ELO.
-   **Database Handling**: For pickup/ranked matches, player team_ids are automatically set to NULL in the database when you select the appropriate match type during processing.
-   **Reports**: Pickup/ranked matches generate player-centric reports rather than team-centric ones.
-   **Report Location**: Team ELO reports go to `stats_reports` directory, while pickup ELO reports should go to `elo_reports_pickup` directory.

## Processing a Single Folder

If you want to process only a specific folder of screenshots (e.g., for a season of team games or a batch of pickup games or just for testing):

1.  **Process screenshots from a specific folder**:
    ```bash
    # Example using TEST folder
    python -m score_extractor.season_processor --base-dir ../Screenshots --season TEST --output-dir "Extracted Results"
    ```
    This processes only the `TEST` folder and saves results to `Extracted Results/TEST/TEST_results.json`.

2.  **Clean the extracted data** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    # Example using TEST folder output
    python -m stats_reader clean --input "Extracted Results/TEST/TEST_results.json" --output "Extracted Results/TEST/TEST_results_cleaned.json"
    ```
    Review and correct potential AI extraction errors (scores, team names, results) against the screenshots for this specific folder. Don't worry about slightly different player names for the same person here.

3.  **Populate and manage the reference database**:
    ```bash
    # Start fresh if necessary by deleting any existing reference database
    # del squadrons_reference.db

    # Populate the reference database with player names from the CLEANED data
    python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --db squadrons_reference.db --populate-from-json "Extracted Results/TEST/TEST_results_cleaned.json"

    # Then manage teams and players using the interactive tool
    python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --db squadrons_reference.db --manage
    ```

    When using the management interface:
    1.  Create teams if needed.
    2.  Assign primary teams and roles, and use "Resolve Duplicate Player IDs" to merge different names for the same player. This also updates the `_cleaned.json` file.

4.  **Process the extracted data into the stats database**:
    ```bash
    python -m stats_reader.stats_db_processor_direct --input "Extracted Results/TEST/TEST_results_cleaned.json" --reference-db squadrons_reference.db
    ```

    When prompted, select the appropriate match type (team, pickup, ranked) and confirm/enter player roles.

5.  **Generate appropriate ELO ladder**:
    ```bash
    # For team matches
    python -m stats_reader.elo_ladder --match-type team

    # For pickup matches
    python -m stats_reader.player_elo_ladder --db squadrons_stats.db --output "elo_reports_pickup" --match-type pickup
    ```

## Workflow Components

Each step in the workflow corresponds to specific components in the project:

| Step                       | Component                                  | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 5a. Generate Team ELO      | `stats_reader/elo_ladder.py`               | Calculates team ELO ratings and generates ladders                                        |
| 5b. Generate Player ELO    | `stats_reader/player_elo_ladder.py`        | Calculates individual player ELO ratings for pickup/ranked matches (includes role history) |

## Reference Database

The reference database (`squadrons_reference.db`) maintains consistent team and player names across matches. For advanced management:

```bash
python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --manage
```

This opens an interactive tool for managing canonical team and player names, including primary roles.

## Player Subbing System

The project tracks whether players are 'subbing' (playing for a team that is not their primary team) to differentiate between regular team appearances and substitute appearances. Here's how it works:

### How Subbing is Determined

1.  **During Import**: The subbing status (is_subbing = 0 or 1) is determined and stored when match data is imported via `stats_db_processor_direct.py`.

2.  **Reference-Based Suggestion**: When importing match data, the system compares:
    -   The player's primary team in the reference database
    -   The team they're playing for in the current match

3.  **User Confirmation**: The system suggests a subbing status (Yes/No) based on team name comparison, but you can override this suggestion during import by answering Yes/No to the prompt.

4.  **Permanent Storage**: Once confirmed, the subbing status is permanently stored in the database with that player's stats for that match. It is not recalculated later.

### Important Note About Player Transfers

If a player changes teams between seasons:

-   **Option 1**: Update their primary team in the reference database using `reference_manager`.
    ```bash
    python -m stats_reader.reference_manager --db squadrons_reference.db --manage
    ```
    Then select Player Management → Edit Player → Update Primary Team.

-   **Option 2**: During import, simply reject the suggested subbing status if it doesn't reflect the historical reality of whether they were subbing at that time.

The crucial detail is that **subbing status is determined and fixed at import time**, not dynamically recalculated based on the current reference database. The reference database only provides default suggestions during import.

### How Subbing Affects Reports

The system generates several reports that use the subbing status differently:

-   `player_performance.json`: Includes ALL games, regardless of subbing status
-   `player_performance_no_subs.json`: Only includes games where is_subbing = 0 (regular team appearances)
-   `subbing_report.json`: Only shows games where is_subbing = 1 (substitute appearances)

## Pickup/Ranked Stats and ELO

For pickup and ranked matches, the system takes a different approach:

-   **No Team Assignment**: Players are not associated with teams (team_id is NULL)
-   **Faction-Based Stats**: Players are still tracked based on their faction (Imperial/Rebel)
-   **Player-Centric ELO**: The ELO system rates individual players instead of teams
-   **Specialized Reports**: Dedicated reports track player performance in pickup/ranked matches

The player ELO system works by:
1.  Calculating the average ELO of all players on each faction in a match
2.  Updating individual player ratings based on match outcomes
3.  Ranking players based on their personal skill level

### Important Note for Pickup ELO

For the pickup player ELO ladder, it is preferred to use the `player_elo_ladder.py` command and store the output in the `elo_reports_pickup` folder:

```bash
python -m stats_reader.player_elo_ladder --db squadrons_stats.db --output "elo_reports_pickup" --match-type pickup
```

This ensures the pickup player ladder is kept separate from the team ladder.

## Match Type Selection

The `stats_db_processor_direct.py` script prompts you to choose the match type (team, pickup, ranked) at the beginning of processing each match. This improvement eliminates the need for a separate step to remove team IDs for pickup and ranked games.

When you choose "pickup" or "ranked" as the match type:
-   Generic team names are automatically assigned
-   Player team_ids are automatically set to NULL in the database
-   No further steps are needed before generating player ELO ladders

This streamlined approach makes it easier to maintain separate ladders for different match types.

# Optional: If you need to fix team IDs for existing pickup/ranked matches in the database
# This command finds pickup/ranked matches where player_stats.team_id is not NULL and sets them to NULL
python -m stats_reader.fix_pickup_team_ids --db squadrons_stats.db

-   You accidentally processed pickup/ranked matches using the team workflow
-   You changed a match's type from "team" to "pickup" or "ranked" after initial processing
-   You're migrating data from an older version of the database structure
-   You want to regenerate pickup/ranked player ELO ladders but get errors about team IDs not being NULL
